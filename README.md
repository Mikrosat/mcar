## About project history 📜
The first version of the project was started at the beginning of January 2025, and it was developed for 2 months. I gave up on it, because then, I was beginner at NodeJS, so my code was terrible. It would take me longer to fix my code, than to start the project from scratch. At the beginning of March, I decided to reprogram my project. Since that day, I am working on, it until today
